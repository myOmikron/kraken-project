# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this project is in its early stages of development, the only supported version is the latest.

This will change in the future.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the kraken team at:

```
kraken-security at omikron.dev
```

The kraken team will acknowledge your email as soon as possible,
and will send a more detailed response afterwards indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, the kraken team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress
towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
